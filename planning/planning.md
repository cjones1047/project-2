## App Concept
- App will be a toolbox for anyone who wants to research what stocks to buy in the stock market
    - Many apps to assist with stock-picking exist like this one today, but this one will have more character by lightly nudging a user towards a time-tested approach to stock-picking called "value-investing"
    - Will be almost entirely quantitative with a major focus on how any given company in the stock market has historically behaved based on its financial statements. 
    - The only qualitative bits of information will be a description of how a company makes its money
        - This description will be taken directly from the business summary section of the company's most recent 10-K

## Theme
- THEME WILL BE BLACK AND WHITE WITH GRAYSCALE AND ONLY ONE COLOR IS GOING TO BE ALLOWED IN THE ENTIRE APP
    - Only color allowed will be some form of light blue
    - I am NOT getting caught up in making this look as pretty as possible.
    - I feel as though endless style tweaking is a rabbit hole I went down on my last project which negatively affected functionality
    - I need this to work smoothely and have complete functionality, which will be quite a stretch in and of itself

 ## Layout   
- App's title at top of navbar oriented down the left-hand side of the screen
- Navbar is oriented down the left-hand side of the page so that each element can be more explicitly named and have it's own row
    - Navbar will also be collapsible at any given point in time
    - Navbar being optionally collapsible as an option promotes a full-screen viewing experience especially useful in viewing spreadsheets that hold years of annual report information on any given company

- Navbar items (when on any given page, that page's respective menu hyperlink will be light blue):
    - [Insert App's Title]
    - More about our way
    - My Stocks [only shows up after user logs in]
    - Search any stock
    - Backtesting
    - [login status]
        - if not logged in, will show "Log In" followed by "Sign Up" to give new users a chance to sign up and give old users a chance to log back in
        - if logged in, will just show the user's username
- Home screen (directed to by clicking app's title)
    - "Stocks are scary. Unless you look at them the right way. [Insert Name of App] will show you our way. Just click 'here' to learn more about our way."
    - "Click on any menu item inside the bar to the left to get started using any of our tools on your own."
- Stretch goals
    - Have a stock price chart provide a render animation over the backtesting time period selected
